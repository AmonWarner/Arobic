# ArobicOS


## Intro
ArobicOS is a Lightweight, Linux-based OS coded in HTML/CSS/JS.

This OS is in ALPHA, so expect bugs.

Arobic is primarily tested as a vm, but you can use this as a primary OS(Just not reccomended)

The OS is all coded in HTML/CSS/JS, but under the hood it uses https://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/ to provide a simple file system and terminal. Everything else is ran by Arobic.
